    
Welcome to my personal site. I know, people don't really do these anymore, but I'm looking for a way outside of social media to share my work and ideas. I'll have my projects, some blogging stuff, and frankly anything else I I feel like putting here.

You'll notice this website is a little simple, even in the style of early personal websites. If you're an employer looking to contact me about work and find yourself unimpressed, please check my interactive resume for a better example of modern front-end UI.
